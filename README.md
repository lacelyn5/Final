Event Management System
Project Overview
The Event Management System is a web-based application designed to manage events. Built with PHP for backend logic and MySQL for database management, the application allows users to register, log in, and manage their events. Docker Compose is used to set up the entire environment for the project.

Technologies Used

PHP 8.1: Backend logic

MySQL: Database management

Docker: Containerization

phpMyAdmin: Web interface for managing the MySQL database

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
To get started with the Event Management System, ensure the following are installed:
Docker
Docker Compose
A web browser (to access the application and phpMyAdmin)

1. Download as ZIP

Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/lacelyn5/Final.
Click the green "Code" button.
Select "Download ZIP" from the options.
Extract the ZIP file to your desired location on your computer.

2. Build and Start the Containers
Open a CMD window go to the folder where the project is located

Use Docker Compose to build and start the application containers:

docker-compose up --build
This command will:

Build Docker images
Start the following containers:
PHP and Apache web server for serving the application
MySQL for database management
phpMyAdmin for managing MySQL through a web interface

3. Accessing the Application
After running docker-compose up --build, you can access the application via the following URLs:

Web Application: http://localhost:8080
phpMyAdmin: http://localhost:8080

4. Setting Up the Database
Once the containers are up, you need to set up the MySQL database. Follow these steps:

Open phpMyAdmin at http://localhost:8081.

Log in using the following credentials:

Username: root
Password: rootpassword (as specified in docker-compose.yml)
Select the event_management database (create it if it doesnâ€™t exist).

Click the SQL tab and paste the following SQL code to create the necessary tables:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS event_management;

USE event_management;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE events (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    event_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
Click Go to execute the SQL and create the tables.

5. Using the Application
Once the database is set up, you can start using the application:

Register a new user by navigating to the registration page.
Login with the credentials you registered.
After logging in, you can:
Create new events
Update existing events
Delete events
Troubleshooting
If the application doesn't start, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are correctly installed.
If you encounter issues with phpMyAdmin, double-check the login credentials in docker-compose.yml.
